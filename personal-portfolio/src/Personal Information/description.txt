My name is Ethan, I am currently a 4th year student at THE Ohio State University studying Management Information Systems.
I have always had an interest in creating things and after finding code to be a wonderful outlet, I have been obcessed ever since.
In my free time I am competitive powerlifter, avid movie nerd and skier, a book worm, and occasional gamer.
