        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p className="self-intro-p">My name is Ethan, I am currently a 4th year student at THE Ohio State University studying Management Information Systems.
            I have always had an interest in creating things and after finding code to be a wonderful outlet, I have been obcessed ever since.
            In my free time I am competitive powerlifter, avid movie nerd and skier, a book worm, and occasional gamer.
            I am currently working as a Software Intern at Neudesic, a Microsoft Gold Partner and tech consulting firm as an intern where I hope
            to learn how to build a fullstack application using react.
            I am hoping to find a full time position with Neudesic after graduation in December 2023.
